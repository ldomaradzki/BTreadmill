- **StravaService**: Handles OAuth authentication and workout upload integration
- **FITWorkoutEncoder**: Generates standards-compliant FIT files for data export

## Development

### Build System
The project uses XcodeGen for project file management:

```bash
# Available commands
make generate    # Generate Xcode project from project.yml
make build      # Build with formatted output
make clean      # Clean build artifacts
make run        # Build and launch
make stop       # Terminate running processes
make archive    # Create distribution archive
```

## Compatibility

### Supported Treadmills
- RZ_TreadMill devices with Bluetooth Low Energy
- Custom protocol for speed control and data reading

### Data Formats
Workout sessions support multiple export formats:

**JSON Format** (for analysis and backup):
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "startTime": "2023-...",
  "totalDistance": 2.5,
  "totalTime": 1800,
  "averageSpeed": 5.0,
  "averagePace": 720,
  "totalSteps": 3200,
  "estimatedCalories": 180,
  "speedHistory": [1.0, 2.5, 3.0, ...],
  "stravaActivityId": "12345678",
  "fitFilePath": "/path/to/workout.fit"
}
```

**FIT Format** (for Strava and fitness platforms):
- Standards-compliant Garmin FIT files
- Real-time generation during workouts
- Automatic upload to Strava
- Compatible with all major fitness platforms

## Privacy

BTreadmill stores all data locally on your device. Workout history and user preferences are saved in local JSON files. 

**Strava Integration**: When you choose to connect to Strava, workout data (FIT files) is transmitted directly to Strava's servers using their official API. This is entirely optional and controlled by you. Authentication tokens are stored securely in your system keychain.
